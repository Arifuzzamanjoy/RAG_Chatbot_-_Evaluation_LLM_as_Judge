        "- **Groundedness:** Can we find the answer to the question in the provided context?\n",
        "- **Relevance:** Does the question matter to people? For example, asking about the release date of a specific version of software isn't really useful for machine learning professionals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sometimes, a question might be too specific to the context it was created in and not make sense on its own, like asking for the name of a function mentioned in a guide.\n",

        "We also have a critique agent for this issue:\n",
        "- **Stand-alone:** Can someone understand the question without needing extra information, as long as they know the subject or can search online? An example of a question that wouldn't pass this test is asking about a function mentioned in a particular article.\n",

        "We'll give scores to the questions with all these agents, and if any question gets a low score, we won't include it in our evaluation dataset.\n",
