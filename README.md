## RAG Chatbot Evaluation Methodology

The evaluation strategy for the RAG chatbot is designed to maximize performance through a series of targeted improvements. The following components are critical to the evaluation process:

- **Chunk Size Optimization**: Identifying the ideal chunk size is essential. It ensures that the language model has enough context to generate accurate responses without being overwhelmed by extraneous information.
- **Embedding Model Selection**: The embedding model's ability to accurately represent text is paramount. A high-quality embedding model can significantly enhance retrieval accuracy, thereby improving the chatbot's overall performance.
- **Snippet Reranking**: Fine-tuning the snippet selection process through reranking ensures that the most relevant information is presented to the reader language model.
- **Reader Language Model (LLM) Enhancement**: The core of the chatbot, the reader LLM, is instrumental in determining response quality. Utilizing an advanced LLM leads to more accurate interpretations of context and more precise answers.

These elements are integral to the evaluation framework, enabling systematic improvements in the chatbot's accuracy and functionality. The ongoing process of testing and refinement ensures continual enhancement of the chatbot's capabilities.
